# Lab Notebook (`/lnb`)

A structured, append-only research notebook.

## Command Dispatch

Parse the first word of `$ARGUMENTS`:

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `log` | Go to **Log** |
| `recall` | Go to **Recall** |
| `init` | Go to **Init** |
| `onboard` | Go to **Onboard** |
| *(empty or unrecognized)* | Show usage: `/lnb log <what to log>`, `/lnb recall <question>`, `/lnb init`, `/lnb onboard` |

Before executing any command (except `init` and `onboard` themselves), run the **Environment Check**. If it fails, offer the user a choice between **Init** (project-local) and **Onboard** (global), then return to the original command.

---

## Environment Check

The CLI handles notebook discovery automatically (`$LAB_NOTEBOOK_DIR` → nearest `.lnb.env` walking up from CWD → error). Verify it can find a notebook:

```bash
lab-notebook schema >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "OK" || echo "NO_NOTEBOOK"
```

- If `OK` → notebook found. Proceed.
- If `NO_NOTEBOOK` → tell the user:

> No notebook found. You can:
> - `/lnb init` — set up a project-local notebook in this directory
> - `/lnb onboard` — set up a global notebook

Wait for the user's choice. After setup completes, proceed directly to the original command.

---

## Init

Project-local notebook setup. The CLI creates a `.lnb.env` file in the current directory and a notebook at `.lnb/` (or a custom path). All `lab-notebook` commands then auto-discover it.

### Step 1: Pick a notebook path

Ask:

> Where should this project's notebook live? (default: `./.lnb` in the current directory)

### Step 2: Run init

```bash
lab-notebook init [<path>]
```

Omit `<path>` to use the default `.lnb/`. The CLI will:
- Create the notebook directory with `entries/`, `artifacts/`, `schema.yaml`, `.gitignore`
- Write `.lnb.env` in the current directory
- Warn if `.lnb.env` already exists (overwrites it)

If the command fails, show the error and stop.

### Step 3: Suggest .gitignore entries

The CLI already suggests `.gitignore` additions in its output. If the user wants to add them, offer to append:

```
.lnb.env
.lnb/
```

Wait for the user's preference before modifying `.gitignore`.

### Step 4: Check for a shadowing env var

`$LAB_NOTEBOOK_DIR` takes precedence over `.lnb.env`. If it's already exported (e.g. from a shell profile or a prior `/lnb onboard`), the freshly-written project `.lnb.env` will be silently ignored.

```bash
[ -n "$LAB_NOTEBOOK_DIR" ] && echo "SHADOWED: $LAB_NOTEBOOK_DIR" || echo "OK"
```

- If `OK` → proceed to Step 5.
- If `SHADOWED: <path>` → tell the user:

> `$LAB_NOTEBOOK_DIR` is exported and points at `<path>`. The new project notebook won't be used until you remove the export from your shell profile and **restart Claude Code** — each `bash` tool call inherits env vars from Claude's own process, so unsetting it in your terminal (or inside a single tool call) won't propagate to the verify step below.

Wait for them to restart and re-run (or confirm they want the global notebook to keep winning) before proceeding.

### Step 5: Verify

```bash
lab-notebook schema
```

If it succeeds, tell them:

> Project notebook ready. Any `lab-notebook` command in this directory (or subdirectories) will use this notebook.

---

## Onboard

One-time global setup. Go step by step and confirm before writing anything.

### Step 1: Pick a notebook path

Ask:

> Where should your notebook live? (e.g. `~/lab-notebook`, `/proj/myproject/notebook`)

If the user declines, is unsure, or doesn't answer:

> No problem — I can use the global default at `~/lab-notebook`. Want me to use that?

- If they agree: use `LAB_NOTEBOOK_DIR="$HOME/lab-notebook"` and continue.
- If they decline again: tell them the skill needs `$LAB_NOTEBOOK_DIR` to work, and offer to run `/lnb onboard` whenever they're ready. Stop here.

Also ask (optional):

> What writer ID should be used for your entries? (defaults to `$USER` = your current username)

Set `LAB_NOTEBOOK_WRITER` only if they provide a value different from `$USER`.

### Step 2: Initialize the notebook

First check if the notebook already exists. The CLI always creates a `.lnb/` subdirectory inside the given path. Check both locations to handle re-runs (where `LAB_NOTEBOOK_DIR` already ends in `.lnb`):

```bash
(test -f "$LAB_NOTEBOOK_DIR/schema.yaml" || test -f "$LAB_NOTEBOOK_DIR/.lnb/schema.yaml") && echo "EXISTS" || echo "NEW"
```

- If `EXISTS`: tell the user "Notebook already initialized — skipping init." Proceed to Step 3.
- If `NEW`: run:

```bash
lab-notebook init "$LAB_NOTEBOOK_DIR"
```

This creates the notebook at `$LAB_NOTEBOOK_DIR/.lnb/` and writes `.lnb.env` in the current directory. Since this is global setup, the `.lnb.env` file is not needed — clean it up:

```bash
rm -f .lnb.env
```

If the init command fails (non-zero exit), tell the user:

> Init failed. Check that the path is writable: `ls -ld "<path>"`

Do not proceed past this step on failure.

### Step 3: Set and persist the environment

The notebook lives at `<chosen path>/.lnb/`, so the env var must point there. Export in the current session:

```bash
export LAB_NOTEBOOK_DIR="<chosen path>/.lnb"
```

Then tell the user to add to their shell profile (or a project `.env`) for future sessions:

```bash
export LAB_NOTEBOOK_DIR="<chosen path>/.lnb"
export LAB_NOTEBOOK_WRITER="<username>"  # optional, defaults to $USER
```

### Step 4: Confirm

```bash
lab-notebook schema
```

Show the output to the user. If this succeeds, tell them they're ready. If it fails, tell them init may not have completed successfully and suggest re-running `/lnb onboard`.

## Log

Emit an entry to the notebook. Content comes from `$ARGUMENTS` after the `log` keyword.

If no content was provided after `log`, ask:

> What would you like to log?

### Step 1: Infer the entry type

From the content itself, infer the most likely type before running `lab-notebook schema`:

- Mentions trying/failing/didn't work/broke → `dead-end`
- Mentions deciding/going with/choosing/we'll use → `decision`
- Mentions done/merged/shipped/working/complete → `milestone`
- Mentions wondering/should we/open question/what if → `question`
- Anything else (a measurement, finding, behavior) → `observation`

Propose the inferred type to the user:

> Looks like a **decision**. Correct, or different type?

Only run `lab-notebook schema` if they want to see available types.

### Step 2: Pick the context

Use `topic/subtopic` slugs, e.g. `ssl/pretraining`, `data/loading`. Check existing contexts:

```bash
lab-notebook contexts
```

Infer from conversation context when possible. Ask only if unclear.

### Step 3: Check content length

Before drafting, assess whether the content is too long to fit in a single entry (longer than ~3 sentences, or contains raw output, data dumps, or multiple distinct ideas).

If it is, present the user with options **before** drafting the emit command:

> This seems like a lot for one entry. How would you like to handle it?
>
> **A — Reference a file**: Keep the entry concise and attach the details via `--artifacts <path/to/file>`. Best when the bulk is data, code, or output that lives in a file.
>
> **B — Break it up**: Split into separate `/lnb log` calls — one per distinct insight or decision. Best when there are multiple ideas bundled together.
>
> **C — Distill it**: Summarize to 1-3 sentences capturing the key insight. Best when it's one dense thought that can be compressed.

Wait for the user's choice before proceeding.

If user picks **A**, ask: "What file should I attach?" Then use the path as `--artifacts <path>` in Step 4.

### Step 4: Draft and confirm

```bash
lab-notebook emit \
    --context <context> --type <type> \
    [--artifacts <path>] \
    "content"
```

**Content**: should be 1-3 sentences with specific numbers, file names, or commit hashes. If you chose option C above, the content is already distilled — use it as-is.

Present for confirmation, showing the actual notebook path:

> **Notebook**: `<actual value of $LAB_NOTEBOOK_DIR>`
> **Type**: decision | **Context**: ssl/pretraining
>
> ```bash
> lab-notebook emit --context ssl/pretraining --type decision [--artifacts <path>] "..."
> ```
>
> OK to emit, or adjust?

Only execute after the user confirms.

## Recall

Search the notebook to answer a question. Query comes from `$ARGUMENTS` after the `recall` keyword.

No confirmation needed — reads are non-destructive.

**If no query was provided**, show recent entries as a default:

```bash
lab-notebook sql \
  "SELECT ts, type, context, substr(content,1,100) FROM entries ORDER BY ts DESC LIMIT 10"
```

**Otherwise**, pick the approach based on the question:

- Open-ended or keyword question → keyword search
- "What have we tried / decided / hit?" → SQL filtered by type
- "What contexts / topics exist?" → list contexts
- Counts, date ranges, comparisons → SQL

### Keyword search

```bash
lab-notebook search "<keywords>"
lab-notebook search "<keywords>" --type dead-end
lab-notebook search "<keywords>" --context ssl/pretraining
```

### SQL (for structured questions)

```bash
lab-notebook sql \
  "SELECT ts, type, substr(content,1,80) FROM entries ORDER BY ts DESC LIMIT 10"

lab-notebook sql \
  "SELECT context, ts, substr(content,1,80) FROM entries WHERE type='dead-end' ORDER BY ts DESC"
```

### List contexts

```bash
lab-notebook contexts
```

### Summarize

Present a concise answer citing specific entries (timestamp, context, type). Do not dump raw output.

SQL queries use `substr(content,1,80)` by default for scanning. If the truncated preview isn't enough to answer the question, re-run without `substr()` to see the full content:

```bash
lab-notebook sql \
  "SELECT ts, type, context, content FROM entries WHERE type='dead-end' ORDER BY ts DESC"
```

**If results are empty**, suggest recovery:

> Nothing found. Try:
> - Broader keywords (fewer or shorter terms)
> - Drop `--type` or `--context` filters
> - `/lnb recall` with no args to see recent entries
> - `lab-notebook contexts` to see what topics exist

---

## Templates

```bash
# List available templates
lab-notebook template

# Initialize with a bundled template
lab-notebook init "$LAB_NOTEBOOK_DIR" --template ml-experiment-log

# Initialize with a schema file shipped by the current project
lab-notebook init --template-path ./my-schema.yaml
```

Bundled templates:
- `research-notebook` (default) — observations, decisions, dead-ends, questions, milestones
- `ml-experiment-log` — run-start, run-end, config-change, crash, checkpoint, comparison

Use `--template-path` when your project ships its own schema file rather than relying on a bundled template. Mutually exclusive with `--template`.
